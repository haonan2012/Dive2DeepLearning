#    Finish 2D convolution/filtering by your self. 
#    What you are supposed to do can be described as "median blur", which means by using a sliding window 
#    on an image, your task is not going to do a normal convolution, but to find the median value within 
#    that crop.
#
#    You can assume your input has only one channel. (a.k.a a normal 2D list/vector)
#    And you do need to consider the padding method and size. There are 2 padding ways: REPLICA & ZERO. When 
#    "REPLICA" are given to you, the padded pixels are the same with the border pixels. E.g is [1 2 3] is your
#    image, the padded version will be [(...1 1) 1 2 3 (3 3...)] where how many 1 & 3 in the parenthesis 
#    depends on your padding size. When "ZERO", the padded version will be [(...0 0) 1 2 3 (0 0...)]
#
#    Assume your input's size of the image is W x H, kernel size's m x n. You may first complete a version 
#    with O(W·H·m·n log(m·n)) to O(W·H·m·n·m·n)).
#    Follow up 1: Can it be completed in a shorter time complexity?
#    Follow up 2: Can it be completed in O(W·H·m·n)?
#
#    Python version:
#    def medianBlur(img, kernel, padding_way):
#        img & kernel is List of List; padding_way a string
#        Please finish your code under this blank

def medianBlur(img, kernel, padding_way, pad_size = 2):
    # img & kernel is List of List; padding_way a string
    if padding_way == 'REPLICA':
        img ==
